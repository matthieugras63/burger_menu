# burger_menu

Here is a hamburger menu designed for Simplon.
If you want to use it, all you have to do is to download the whole directory. Once it's done, you will have to link jquery + script files to your pages.
Don't forget to link the CSS file to.

Then, you should be able to include the menu using this:

<?php include index.php ?>
